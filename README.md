### How does your project solve this problem?
Tour List is a web application that provides an easy to read format of music tour information and is accessible on most any screen size. It' designed to be easy on resources, so it can always be loaded even with a slow connection.

### What web APIs did it use?
Bandsintown API

### What technologies did it use?
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Materialize, AJAX, localStorage

### What was the most valuable piece of Customer feedback you received?
Limit focus to central product and achieving primary user stories, not worry about adding extra features.

### What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome?
The predictive search feature didn't make the final application because it had built in CSS that was overriding my own CSS rules, it ended up being more trouble than it was worth. CSS in general was what I struggled with most throughout the process, it consumed the bulk of my time.
